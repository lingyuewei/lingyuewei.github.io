[Severity indices of diquat poisoning for triage and prognosis in acute diquat poisoning: a multi-center prospective cohort study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2025.02.022). Annals of Emergency Medicine, 2025, 85(6), 512-520.
  - This study developed and validated severity indices for diquat poisoning (SIDPs) that enable emergency physicians to assess mortality risk for triage and 28-day prognosis using self-reported clinical data and laboratory biomarkers.
  - This multicenter cohort study involved 204 patients. Predictors identified by the Burota algorithm and stepwise Cox regression were incorporated into Cox proportional hazards models to develop SIDPs, one for triage and one for prognosis (SIDP-T and SIDP-P, respectively).
  - We launched a user-friendly [**online platform**](https://severityindexofdiquatpoisoning.streamlit.app/) that enables emergency physicians to apply severity indices directly at the point of care.

[Influence of the enterovirus 71 vaccine and the covid-19 pandemic on hand, foot, and mouth disease in China based on counterfactual models: Observational study](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e63146). JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 2024, 10, e63146.
  - This study investigated the long-term epidemiological trends of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Yunnan Province, China, and evaluated the impacts of the enterovirus 71 vaccination program and the COVID-19 pandemic using counterfactual autoregressive integrated moving average models.

[Impact of an enhanced recovery after surgery program integrating cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on post-operative prognosis of patients treated with CABG: protocol of the ERAS-CaRe randomized controlled trial](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-024-03286-1). BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2024, 24, 512.
  - This protocol designed a pragmatic, randomized-controlled, parallel four-arm, clinical trial to evaluate potential superiority of embedding cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) over ERAS alone, as well as to investigate effects of differential timing of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation within ERAS (pre-, post-, perio-operative) on post-operative cardiopulmonary complications following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

  - This study developed a VMD-CSA-CNN-LSTM model to predict air quality index, using variational mode decomposition (VMD), chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
  - The developed model was validated using data from nine representative cities in China (Hohhot, Yinchuan, Lanzhou, Beijing, Taiyuan, and Xi’an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan), and random forest algorithm was used to identify major air pollutants in each city.

Chinese Journal of Health Policy, 2024, 17(3), 48-55. (In Chinese)
  - This study developed a value adjustor for inpatient rehabilitation services, which can provide comparable assessment of rehabilitation outcomes, and further support value-based payment reform under Chinese healthcare insurance system.

  - This study found three cognitive trajectories among Chinese adults aged 45 and older with diabetes using data from the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). 
  - We employed a growth mixture model to identify cognitive trajectories, and examined baseline risk factors using weighted multinomial logistic regression.
